# First-step
My first ever attempt at coding an entire web layout


Created the header layout, i used a placeholder background image since the original layout used a specific shape. 

Had to make a few adjustments to the "top" values, the original ones didn't fit well.

There's still room for some organizations, crate folder for images and pages, etc...

I still have some adjustments to make, the footer section for example are being forged. It's a W.I.P.
