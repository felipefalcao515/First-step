# First-step
My first ever attempt at coding an entire web layout


Created the header layout, i used a placeholder background image since the original layout used a specific shape. Changes:

- Made changes to the classes names, making it easier to spot;
- Added a section for the sample text;
- Added name, mail, cpf, genre* text boxes;
    * for the genre i created only to li's, one for male and one for female, this way the user can mark the checkbox by clicking both the circle and text;
- Added another section for the future products list;

Had to make a few adjustments to the "top" values, the original ones didn't fit well.

There's still room for some organizations, create folder for the images and pages, etc...

I still have some adjustments to make, working right now on the rest of the sections and on making the code dryer. It's a W.I.P.
