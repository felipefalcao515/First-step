# First-step
The build is basecly the layout and ui, the ui could use more adjustment like centering and using a better image for the header and footer background.

Since the JS is unavailable, the buttons and product list is a placeholder for what it was supposed to be;

For the startup, i used Netifly method of deployment. In my opinion its the easiest to work with. I threw the folder there and they did the work.

I used the sample text aswell, thought was a good touch for the test. The buttons were customizade accordingly, sadly the checkbox is a bit wonky.

The text input for names, emails, etc ... are working better than i expected, after all its meant to receive text so what else could i expect.

Overall the uncentered position gets on my nerves, the lack of JS is also worring. But i'll keep working on it even after the test, so i can fix alot of stuff, maybe dry the code more, and add more where its lacking.

I learned so much and had to google alot of things i didn't know before, i thank you all for this oportunity, with hearth.
